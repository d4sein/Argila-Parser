# Argila-Parser

### What is it?
It's a lib written in Python meant to help develop CLI programs more easily.

### How can I use it?
Simply add `argila.py` to your project folder and you're good to go.

### How does it work?
It works by class inheritance and decorators. You will create a class to inherit from *Argila*; Every method in that class will represent a command, and by decorating your methods you can add new fuctionalities to it.
